# React Login Form

This repository contains a simple React web application that demonstrates a basic login form. The application consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.

- `index.css`: CSS file for styling the application.

- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that sets up the React app and renders the `App` component to the HTML `div` element with the id `root`.

- `App.jsx`: The main React component, `App`, that serves as the container for the login form.

- `LoginForm.jsx`: A separate React component, `LoginForm`, responsible for rendering the login form. This component uses styled-components for styling.
